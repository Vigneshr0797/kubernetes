Dear Team,

We have cleared the unwanted images and deployments, so the current usage is now optimized.

As discussed, we require an additional 50GB of storage to proceed further. Other than that, no additional images are needed at this moment.

Kindly allocate the requested storage at the earliest.

Thanks & Regards,
Vignesh R.
