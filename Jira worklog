✅ Jira Summary

Implement ArgoCD Deployment in Kubernetes Cluster with GitLab Integration

⸻

✅ Jira Description

Objective:
Set up and configure ArgoCD in our on-prem Kubernetes cluster and integrate it with GitLab to enable automated GitOps-based deployments.

Scope of Work:
	1.	Install ArgoCD
	•	Deploy ArgoCD components in a dedicated namespace (argocd).
	•	Expose ArgoCD server using NodePort/Ingress based on cluster configuration.
	•	Configure RBAC and service accounts as required.
	2.	Cluster Configuration
	•	Verify connectivity with Kubernetes API server.
	•	Create necessary Kubernetes roles and permissions for ArgoCD to manage workloads.
	3.	GitLab Integration
	•	Connect ArgoCD to our GitLab repository.
	•	Set up GitLab access tokens for secure communication.
	•	Configure automatic sync/pull for manifests/Helm charts.
	4.	Application Onboarding
	•	Create ArgoCD application definitions pointing to GitLab repos.
	•	Configure auto-sync, webhook triggers, and deployment policies.
	5.	Testing & Validation
	•	Validate deployment workflows.
	•	Test auto-sync and Git push-driven deployments.
	•	Ensure rollback and health checks work as expected.
	6.	Documentation
	•	Prepare detailed setup notes and operational guidelines.
	•	Provide troubleshooting steps for common issues.

Expected Outcome:
A fully functional ArgoCD GitOps workflow linked to GitLab, enabling automated deployments to our Kubernetes environments.

✅ Worklog Comment

Worked on installing and configuring ArgoCD in the Kubernetes cluster. Created the argocd namespace, deployed core ArgoCD components, and validated the server connectivity. Integrated ArgoCD with GitLab by adding repository credentials and access tokens. Configured application sync settings and tested deployments triggered through GitLab commits. Documented setup steps and verified functionality end-to-end.

If you want, I can also generate:

✔ A more technical version
✔ A shorter version for sprint updates
✔ A step-by-step installation checklist

Just tell me!

Here is a more technical and detailed worklog you can paste directly into Jira.
I’ve broken it into clear technical steps with strong DevOps/Kubernetes terminology.

🔧 Detailed Technical Worklog Comment (Highly Technical)

• Created the argocd namespace and deployed ArgoCD core components using the official ArgoCD installation manifests.
• Verified all ArgoCD pods (repo-server, application-controller, server, dex) reached Running state and resolved any image pull or RBAC issues.
• Exposed the ArgoCD server using Ingress/NodePort and validated UI/API accessibility.
• Retrieved the initial admin password from the ArgoCD secret and tested login via CLI (argocd login) and UI.

• Configured ArgoCD RBAC: created service accounts, cluster roles, and bindings to allow ArgoCD to manage workloads in target namespaces.
• Registered the Kubernetes cluster with ArgoCD using argocd cluster add and validated cluster connectivity + permissions.

• Created GitLab Personal Access Token with required scopes and added it as a repository credential in ArgoCD.
• Connected the GitLab repo (manifests/Helm charts) to ArgoCD and validated repository reachability and webhook authentication.

• Created the ArgoCD Application manifest (YAML) with project, target revision, destination namespace, and sync policy (auto-sync + prune + self-heal).
• Synced the application and validated that ArgoCD correctly deployed all Kubernetes objects (deployments, services, ingress, configmaps, secrets).
• Performed tests by pushing updates to GitLab and confirming that ArgoCD auto-synced changes (GitOps flow validation).

• Validated rollback functionality, resource health checks, and sync wave ordering.
• Collected logs from argocd-server and application-controller to verify event workflow and debug repository sync operations.

• Documented installation steps, repo configuration, sync policies, cluster registration process, and troubleshooting notes for internal use.

If you want, I can also prepare:

✅ A shorter sprint-style worklog
✅ A version with exact commands used (kubectl/helm/argocd CLI)
✅ A version written as bullet points for daily scrum
