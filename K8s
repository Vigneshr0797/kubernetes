Hi Naveenraja,

Previously also, one of your team members had performed similar activities on the below-mentioned Kubernetes SIT servers. After those cluster changes, the Calico nodes crashed, and all the servers went down. I had to completely reconfigure the entire SIT setup at that time.

In view of this, I kindly request that no changes be made to the below-mentioned servers.

Thank you for your understanding.

Regards,  
Vignesh
