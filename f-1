Excellent — this image shows clearly what’s happening.
Your Falco DaemonSet failed to start with this key error message 👇

```
Error creating: pods "falco-*" is forbidden: error looking up service account falco/falco: serviceaccount "falco" not found
```

That means Kubernetes can’t find the **ServiceAccount** named `falco` in the namespace `falco`.

Let’s fix it cleanly 👇

---

## 🧩 Root Cause

You applied the DaemonSet, but the **ServiceAccount**, **ClusterRole**, and **ClusterRoleBinding** were either:

* not yet applied, or
* not created in the correct namespace.

So, Falco’s pods cannot start because they lack permission to run under `falco` ServiceAccount.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Fix

### **1️⃣ Create the namespace and ServiceAccount**

Run this first:

```bash
kubectl create namespace falco
kubectl -n falco create serviceaccount falco
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl -n falco get sa
```

You should see:

```
NAME      SECRETS   AGE
default   1         5s
falco     1         3s
```

---

### **2️⃣ Apply RBAC roles**

Now apply this RBAC config (you can copy this to a file `falco-rbac.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: falco-cluster-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - pods
      - namespaces
      - nodes
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: falco-cluster-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: falco-cluster-role
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: falco
    namespace: falco

```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f falco-rbac.yaml
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get clusterrolebinding falco-cluster-rolebinding -o yaml
```

---

### **3️⃣ Reapply your Falco DaemonSet**

Now that the service account exists, reapply your DaemonSet YAML:

```bash
kubectl -n falco apply -f falco-daemonset.yaml
```

---

### **4️⃣ Check Deployment**

```bash
kubectl -n falco get pods -o wide
```

You should now see pods in `Running` state (1/1 READY).

Then check logs:

```bash
kubectl -n falco logs -l app=falco --tail=30
```

✅ Expected:

```
Falco initialized with modern_ebpf driver
Loading rules from /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml
Starting event loop
```

---

### **5️⃣ (Optional) Clean old failed pods**

```bash
kubectl -n falco delete pods --all
```

Then wait for new pods to appear:

```bash
kubectl -n falco get pods -w
```

---

Once these steps are done, your DaemonSet will correctly launch on all nodes using:

* the **`falco` ServiceAccount**,
* the **ClusterRole permissions**, and
* the **eBPF runtime mode**.

---

Would you like me to include the **Falco Driver Loader DaemonSet YAML (0.41.3)** next, so it loads automatically before Falco starts (in case you want to keep driver-loader as a separate DaemonSet)?
