Subject: Request to Review Consolidated List of APIs Across Non-Prod Environments

Dear Team,

We have consolidated the list of APIs currently available across all non-production environments. Please review the attached sheet and let us know if any APIs are missing. This information is essential for us to proceed with creating the required pipelines.

Kindly note that all APIs available in UAT are also present in SIT. However, in Pre-Prod, most APIs do not yet have pipelines. We request your support in reviewing the list and providing updates wherever necessary.

Special thanks to Pooja for consolidating this sheet.

Your timely inputs will help us ensure accurate pipeline setup.
