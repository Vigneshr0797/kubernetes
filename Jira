Below is the exact Jira behavior and how you can achieve syncing time tracking (Original Estimate & Worklog) from Sub-tasks → Task → Epic.

⸻

✅ Why your Epic is NOT showing synced time

By default:
	•	Worklogs roll up only within the Story/Task hierarchy
(Sub-task → Task/Story).
	•	Epics DO NOT automatically aggregate time tracking from Tasks/Sub-tasks.
Jira treats Epics as separate issue types and does not roll up time by default.

So even if you:
	•	Add Original Estimate in Epic
	•	Add Worklog in Task / Sub-task

👉 Jira will NOT sync it unless you use Automation, Portfolio/Advanced Roadmaps, or Third-party plugins.

✅ Solution 1 — FREE & Recommended: Jira Automation Rule

You can create an automation rule to sum the worklog from all child issues into the Epic.

Steps to configure:

1️⃣ Go to:

Project Settings → Automation → Create Rule

2️⃣ Trigger

Choose:

Work Logged

This triggers whenever someone logs time on a task/sub-task.

3️⃣ Branch Rule

Add a branch:

For Parent → Epic

4️⃣ Action

Choose:

Edit Issue → Additional Fields

Add the following JSON (sums worklogs):

{
  "fields": {
    "timetracking": {
      "remainingEstimate": "{{#=}}{{issue.timetracking.originalEstimateSeconds}} - {{issue.timetracking.timeSpentSeconds}}{{/}}",
      "originalEstimate": "{{issue.timetracking.originalEstimate}}"
    }
  }
}

Or if you want the Epic to show total time spent of all child issues:

{
  "fields": {
    "customfield_10016": "{{epic.sum.timeSpent}}"
  }
}

(Note: customfield_10016 is the “Time Spent” field — your field ID may differ.)

⸻

✅ Solution 2 — Sum Original Estimate from tasks to Epic

Use trigger:

Issue Updated

Branch:

For Epic (Parent)

Action:

Recalculate field → Original Estimate

JSON:

{
  "fields": {
    "timetracking": {
      "originalEstimate": "{{lookupIssues.Sum.timetracking.originalEstimateSeconds}}"
    }
  }
}


⸻

✅ Solution 3 — Use Advanced Roadmaps (if you have Premium)

If your Jira edition has Advanced Roadmaps, time tracking roll-up is built in.

Go to:

Plans → Create Plan → Add Issue Sources

Enable roll-ups:

Plan Settings → Calculations → Roll-up → Time Tracking

Then it automatically shows:

✔ Epic Total Estimate
✔ Epic Total Time Logged
✔ Remaining Estimate

⸻

✅ Solution 4 — Use plugins (if automation is hard)

Plugins that support Epic time rollup:
	•	Tempo Timesheets (best)
	•	WorklogPRO
	•	Time in Status
	•	BigPicture / BigGantt

These instantly aggregate rollups with zero setup.

⭐ Best Working Setup for You

Based on your screenshots, you are using Jira Server/DC with no plugins.

So the easiest working method:

✔ Use Automation Rule (Solution 1)

It will:
	•	Whenever Subtask logs time → Task updates
	•	Task logs time → Epic time updates
	•	Epic always shows total worked hours

⸻

If you want, I can create the exact automation JSON for:
	•	Rolling up worklog to Task
	•	Rolling up Task total to Epic
	•	Recalculating remaining estimate

Just tell me what exact fields you want to sync:

A) Only Time Spent

B) Time Spent + Remaining

C) Original Estimate + Time Spent + Remaining

I can generate the ready-to-import rule for you.
