DevOps Process Overview – On-Prem Spring Boot Deployment (Equitas Bank)
 
DevOps Workflow Summary
 
•End-to-end CI/CD pipeline for on-prem Java/Spring Boot microservices
•Automated build, quality checks, artifact storage, and deployment
•Ensures consistency, security, and reliability across environments
•Supports deployments on both Linux servers and Kubernetes clusters

Source Code Management – Branching Strategy
 
•Structured branches: dev, uat, preprod, prod
•Developers commit only to dev branch
•Merge Requests enforced for higher environments
•Approval process involving EA managers/reviewers
•Clean, traceable, and governed code movement
Code Quality & Security – SonarQube
 
•Automatic code scan triggered in Jenkins
•Detects vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells
•Quality gate enforced before proceeding
•Improves maintainability and reduces production issues

Artifact Management – JFrog Artifactory
 
•Stores all built JAR artifacts
•Version-controlled repository for builds
•Reliable rollback and re-deployment support
•Consistent artifact availability across environments
Deployment Targets
 
•On-Prem Deployment Servers: traditional JAR execution, systemd/service scripts
•Kubernetes Deployments: container-based, YAML updates, scaling & health checks
•Higher resilience and easier management at scale
Jenkins Pipeline Overview – Environment Setup
 
•Define variables and credentials
•Prepare workspace
•Configure project-level settings
Code Checkout & Sonar – CI Stage
 
•Checkout code from GitLab
•Run SonarQube static analysis
•Generate quality and coverage reports
•Validate quality gate
Build Stage – CI
 
•Compile source code
•Run unit tests
•Package into JAR using Maven/Gradle
•Upload artifact to Artifactory
Deployment Process – CD
 
•Stop old running process safely
•Fetch new JAR from Artifactory
•Deploy and start new service
•Validate logs and health checks
