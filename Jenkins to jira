Dear Vamsi,

As discussed, we are planning to integrate Jira with our Jenkins environment in the UAT setup for build automation purposes. For this integration, we require admin access to create the necessary API token.

Additionally, we need to verify whether the Jenkins for Jira plugin is available for our on-premises Jira instance. I have shared the plugin name and screenshot for your reference. Kindly check its availability and, if supported, please proceed with installing the required plugin to enable the integration.

Thank you.
